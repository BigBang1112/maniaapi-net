# ManiaAPI.NET

**The project is currently being rewritten for V2 to support even more testability and injectability.** Stay tuned.

Currently a wrapper for these web APIs:

- Nadeo API (official TM2020 ingame API)
- Trackmania web API
- Trackmania.io
- Trackmania Exchange

Soon:

- ManiaPlanet web API
- XML-RPC (for TMF and ManiaPlanet)

This set of libraries was made to be very easy and straight-forward to use, but also easily mocked, so that it can be integrated into the real world in no time.
