# ManiaAPI.XmlRpc

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/ManiaAPI.XmlRpc?style=for-the-badge&logo=nuget)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ManiaAPI.XmlRpc/)

Integrates the XML-RPC communication used between controllers and servers.

This solution tries to be lightweight and compatible with as many Nadeo games as possible. For a better strongly-typed XML-RPC, use the [GbxRemote.Net](https://github.com/EvoEsports/GbxRemote.Net) library.
